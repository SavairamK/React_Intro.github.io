            <p>I have done two projects on Portfolio and API Fetching. <br />
            I built my portfolio with the help of HTML and CSS. I make four sections in my portfolio. First section is for my education. I shared my education from 10th, 12th and Bachelor's Degree. Second section is for my technical skills. I briefly shared my technical skills. Third section is for my extra information. Fourth section contains contact form. <br />
            Second Project is about API Fetching. For this, I have used API for Music. This project takes the singer name as input from the user and returns the number for songs sung by that perticular singer.</p>
